## Session Recovery Point - 2025-01-11 11:00

### ✅ Progress Made
1. **THREE.Scene is not a constructor** - RESOLVED ✅
   - Created manual mock in `__mocks__/three.js`
   - Mock is now being loaded correctly

2. **Current Error**
   - Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'set')"
   - Location: MathCanvas.tsx:35 (`camera.position.set(5, 5, 5)`)
   - Cause: PerspectiveCamera mock's position property issue

### 🔍 Diagnosis
The mock for PerspectiveCamera is working but the position property isn't being set up correctly. 
Need to check what THREE.PerspectiveCamera is returning when instantiated.

### 📋 Next Steps
1. Add debug logging to see camera object structure
2. Fix PerspectiveCamera mock to ensure position property exists
3. Test all other Three.js object mocks
4. Fix GestureManager tests

### 💾 Recovery Commands
```bash
cd C:\palantir\math\frontend
npm test -- --testNamePattern="renders without crashing" --no-coverage
```

### Files Modified
- `__mocks__/three.js` - Created manual mock
- `src/setupTests.ts` - Simplified to use manual mock  
- `src/components/MathCanvas.test.tsx` - Removed duplicate mocks
- `SESSION_CHECKPOINT.json` - Session state saved
